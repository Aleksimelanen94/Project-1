To do list project by Aleksi Melanen

I have made a basic to do list where you can add things to do in to a list.
You can also add time for things and add a check mark to thing that have been done or you can delete it from the list

You can save your list and it loads when the page is loaded. There is a weird bug that it doesnt for some reason return everything from your list
and it seems to always be the second thing on your list. (i have no idea why it does that).
List also doesnt save checkmarks because i ran out of time when thinking how to make that work. Also the weird list returning bug made me lose a lot of time. 

But i think i did an ok job with the list applikation. it has all the features i wanted to add and it kind of works.
